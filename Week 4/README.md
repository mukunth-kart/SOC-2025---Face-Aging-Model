**Week 4**

In week 4, we focused on the tools which would help us build a pipeline to process our images and basically make a pipeline which maps our dataset inputs into our network,
These tools are openCV, PIL and torchvision transforms.
For the OpenCV part alone I followed a different video series than the one given by the mentor. It was from a learner's space course taken by me.
I also implemented alexNet on the CelebA dataset with pytorch.
You can find the relevant code in PIL, openCV ad CelebA.
