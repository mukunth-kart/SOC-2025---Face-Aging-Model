**Week 2**

Could be said to be the true beginning of coding. If you exclude the basics of python from week 1.
The mentor provided both videos of actual coding using both tensorflow and pytorch.
However, I felt there was more of a focus in pytorch, which I understood after learning that the resources of the next week majorly consisted of pytorch code.
We also learnt on how to setup conda environment with pycharm.

There were also videos providing theoritical understanding of neural networks.
