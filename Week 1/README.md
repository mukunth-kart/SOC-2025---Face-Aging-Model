**Week 1**

Week 1 was more of an introduction to python and a theoritical understanding of deep learning and machine learning.
It also focused on the introduction of google colab to absolute beginners with no knowledge of colab.

However, I was already exposed to google colab, learnt python in school and had watched many videos on deep learning before this project and hence only used the videos provided by the mentor when I needed to revise a concept.
There was no such "coding" as far as week 1 content is concerned.
